# GPN Client

A client implementation for the tron game that was playable at GPN 2023: https://github.com/freehuntx/gpn-tron

I only participated remotely back then and my original implementation was lost. However, since we did a small coding excercise with
this project at work as well, I decided to try and rewrite it again.
